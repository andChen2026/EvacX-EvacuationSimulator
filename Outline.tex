\section*{\huge Evacuation Simulation: EvacX}
\subsection*{Context}
\hspace*{6mm} In our modern world, we unfortunately have to deal with many unprecedented events that may happen in our lives. From flooding in coastal cities, tornadoes in the midwest, to even the horrible intruder threats in our schools. In many cases, local governments have been caught off-guard, with many not even mounting a proper response until hours later. Denizens of affected or at risk communities may wonder, "is there anything that can be done?" \\[5pt]
\hspace*{6mm} Our group says that there is. EvacX is a simulator that will be able to mount a much better response than past measures. In this project, we will use active intruder threats as an example to display the suite of functionality EvacX is capable of.
